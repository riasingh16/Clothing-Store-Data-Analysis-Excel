# Clothing-Store-Data-Analysis-Excel

This project focuses on analyzing sales data for Kristen's Clothing Store to uncover key insights about customer behavior and purchasing patterns. Key objectives include identifying peak sales periods, understanding demographic trends, and optimizing marketing strategies.

The project involves creating various charts and pivot tables to visualize data effectively, including combo charts for sales vs. orders, pie charts for sales by gender and order status, and bar/column charts for regional and generational sales comparisons. Slicers for month, category, and channels are also utilized to filter and view data dynamically.
